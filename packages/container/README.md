## `@sensejs/container`

This package was created with the mission to replace [inversify].

By supporting **resolve session**, **aliasing**, and **resolve interceptor** natively, which required by
`@sensejs/core` but had to be emulated inefficiently when [inversify] was in used, huge performance improvement was
gained.
